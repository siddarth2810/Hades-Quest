    <p>Hades Quest is like a to-do list game inspired by the video game "Hades." It's based on ancient Greek stories,
      and in our version, you follow the adventures of a hero named Zagreus. He's trying to leave the Underworld, and he
      needs help from three gods: Ares, Aphrodite, and Athena.

    <p> Each god is in charge of different types of tasks - Ares helps with fitness, Aphrodite with self-care, and
      Athena with school or work stuff. <br>

    <p>
      When you finish tasks from these gods, you'll see a progress bar go up, and your level will go up too. But there's
      a catch: your level only goes up when you finish tasks from all three gods. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's like going on a big journey, just like Zagreus's adventure, and each task you finish brings you closer to
      your goal. "Hades Quest" is your chance to tackle your to-do list and earn cool rewards, just like a hero in a
      story. Your quest begins now! <br>
