# Hades-Quest - A gamified todo-list to make completing your tasks more FUN !

## Introduction
Inspired by the game **HADES**, Hades-Quest is a gamified to-do list in which three gods control various task categories: Ares helps with fitness, Aphrodite with self-care, and Athena with academic or professional matters. To escape the Underworld, our hero must level up. As you do your daily tasks, the bar increases, **but here's the catch:** our hero will only level up if you finish tasks assigned equally by all the gods.
